Put the LED on the breadboard. Identify the legs: long = anode (+), short = cathode (−).

Connect the anode (long leg) of the red LED to Arduino digital pin 13 through a 220 Ω resistor.

(Pin 13) → (220 Ω resistor) → (LED anode)

Connect the cathode (short leg) of the red LED to GND on the Arduino.

Repeat the same for the other LEDs:

Yellow LED: (Pin 12) → 220 Ω → LED anode ; LED cathode → GND

Green LED: (Pin 11) → 220 Ω → LED anode ; LED cathode → GND

Connect the Arduino GND pin to the breadboard ground rail if you use the rail for all cathodes.
