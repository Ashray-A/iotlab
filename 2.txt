LDR LED
int ldrPin = A0;  // LDR connected to analog pin A0
int ledPin = 13;   // LED connected to pin 13
int ldrValue = 0;
int threshold = 500; // Adjust based on your light conditions

void setup() {
  pinMode(ledPin, OUTPUT);
}

void loop() {
  ldrValue = analogRead(ldrPin); // Read LDR value (0 - 1023)

  if (ldrValue < threshold) {    // If it's dark
    digitalWrite(ledPin, HIGH);  // Turn LED ON
  } else {                       // If it's bright
    digitalWrite(ledPin, LOW);   // Turn LED OFF
  }

  delay(100); // Small delay for stability
}





Connect Arduino 5V to the top rail of the breadboard (or directly to one end of the LDR).

Connect one leg of the LDR to 5V.

Connect the other leg of the LDR to the A0 input (also to one end of the 10 kΩ resistor).

In practice: 5V → LDR → junction (A0) → 10kΩ → GND.

Connect the other end of the 10 kΩ resistor to GND.

The junction between LDR and 10kΩ is the analog voltage the Arduino reads with analogRead(A0).

LED: if using the built-in LED on D13, no hardware needed.
If using an external LED:

Arduino D13 → 220 Ω resistor → LED anode (long leg).

LED cathode (short leg) → GND.

Connect Arduino GND to the breadboard ground rail so the resistor and LED share common ground.
